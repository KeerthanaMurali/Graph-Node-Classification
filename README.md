# Graph-Node-Classification

perform the node classification in this graph
dataset.


With the true value and predicted value , we can calculate the metrics like accuracy,f1score,matthews correlation coefficient of this classifier model.The classification report is also generated in order to know the metrics based on each classes.

With the true value and predicted value, we can calculate the metrics like accuracy, f1score, Matthews correlation coefficient of this classifier model. The accuracy is 78.37%. Also, the label wise classification is also generated. Recall provides us with the true positive predictions, or the sensitivity and we can find that its values is 0.744 which indicates there is good number of positive predictions. Precision provides with the exactness of the classifier model and its value is 0.78 which means it has more True positives than False positives so our model is more exact.F1 score is harmonic mean of precision and recall therefore it is very important metric to be considered while building a classifier model, When it is high and almost equal to 1 it would be a best model. For us in this case we have a 0.75, which is a very good score. The classification report below just provides us the metrics based on each of the classification labels or number of classes in which the data must be classified.
